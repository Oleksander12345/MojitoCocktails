## 💡 About the Project

I recreated the scroll-driven cinematic experience inspired by the reference site, focusing on immersive motion and storytelling through animations, video, and layout.

### 🔁 Creative Replacement for 3D:
Instead of replicating the 3D model, I used:
- High-quality atmospheric video backgrounds.
- Scroll-based pinning, scaling, fading via GSAP + ScrollTrigger.
- Parallax-inspired scenes and layered gradients.

### ✨ Why Two Versions?
I explored two creative directions:
1. **Main version** — darker and more cinematic, closer to the original aesthetic.
2. **Light variation** — a playful and airy interpretation with the same technical core.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger
- Tailwind CSS
- AI-generated assets (images/video)

## 🧪 Performance
Both versions tested on desktop and mobile.
- Optimized assets & lazy loading
- Scroll interactions run at 60 FPS

## 📁 Source Code
Everything is in this repository. Each scene is split into its own React component for modularity and clarity.
